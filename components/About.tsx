          Nearly three years ago, I decided to switch career paths and pursue
          web development. Since then, I have learned many new technologies
          focusing primarily on React. As a QA software engineer, my
          problem-solving skills are put to the test on a daily basis. I am
          expected to provide clear communication and documentation when
          collaborating with the software development team. Fortunately, my
          current position has taught me how to work in a agile environment and
          prioritize tasks.

          During my coding journey, I have worked on many full-stack
          applications using Node and React. Over the years, I have improved my
          design skills using APIs such as Tailwind CSS and Material UI. Most of
          my projects include databases using either Postgres or Firebase.{' '}
